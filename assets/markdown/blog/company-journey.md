# ChemActiva's Journey: From Inception to Innovation

*Published on July 28, 2024 by Dr. Goutam Kulsi*

As I reflect on our remarkable journey from a simple idea to a recognized leader in sustainable nanocellulose technology, I'm filled with pride at what we've accomplished and excitement for what lies ahead. Today, I want to share the story of ChemActiva Innovations – our challenges, breakthroughs, and the milestones that have shaped our path to becoming a pioneering force in clean technology.

## The Beginning: January 2023

It all started on January 6th, 2023, when ChemActiva Innovations Pvt Ltd was officially incorporated. What began as a vision to address pressing environmental challenges through innovative chemical solutions was about to become reality. Our founding was rooted in a simple yet powerful belief: that advanced chemical processes and green technologies could build a cleaner, more sustainable future.

The early days were filled with uncertainty and excitement. We had the scientific knowledge, the passion, and the vision, but transforming these into a viable business required determination and strategic thinking. The decision to focus on nanocellulose technology wasn't arbitrary – it represented the perfect intersection of sustainability, performance, and market opportunity.

## Finding Our Home: RISE Foundation IISER

Just one month after incorporation, on February 1st, 2023, we achieved our first major milestone: being accepted into the RISE Foundation at IISER Kolkata. This wasn't just about finding office space; it was about joining a community of innovators and gaining access to world-class research facilities.

Being incubated at RISE Foundation IISER provided us with invaluable resources:
- Access to cutting-edge laboratory equipment
- Mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and researchers
- Networking opportunities with other startups
- A collaborative environment that fostered innovation

The location at IISER Kolkata also gave us proximity to some of India's brightest minds in chemical sciences, which proved instrumental in our research and development efforts.

## Building the Team

No company succeeds without the right people, and 2023 was the year we assembled our core team. Dr. Soumitra Hazra joined us as Scientific Manager, bringing his expertise from CSIR-IICB and postdoctoral experience in Japan. His technical depth and industry knowledge became crucial in our product development efforts.

Ms. Pompa Dan came aboard as our Finance Manager, bringing her analytical skills and M.Sc. in Physics background to manage our financial planning and budgets. Having a strong financial foundation was essential as we navigated the challenging startup landscape.

The addition of Uma Paul as Supply Chain Manager ensured we could effectively manage our raw material procurement and build efficient supply chains – critical for our manufacturing operations.

## The Research Breakthroughs

Throughout 2023, our research team worked tirelessly to develop what would become our flagship products. The development of Greenulos™, our sodium salt of carboxylated crystalline nano cellulose, represented months of experimentation and refinement.

Key breakthroughs included:
- Optimizing the carboxylation process for enhanced performance
- Achieving high-quality crystalline structure while maintaining biodegradability
- Developing production processes that minimized carbon footprint
- Creating both powder and liquid forms for diverse applications

Simultaneously, we were developing our oil spill kit technology, harnessing the natural hydrophobic and oleophilic properties of non-edible plant materials. The discovery that our materials could absorb oil up to 50 times their weight was a game-changer that opened up entirely new market opportunities.

## Recognition and Validation: 2024

The year 2024 brought external validation of our work through significant grant awards. On January 6th, 2024 – exactly one year after our incorporation – we were awarded the DST-NIDHI PRAYAS startup grant of 10 lakhs from the Savli Technology & Business Incubator (STBI) in Gujarat.

This recognition from the Department of Science and Technology was more than just financial support; it was validation that our technology had genuine potential to make a significant impact. The grant enabled us to:
- Accelerate our research and development activities
- Invest in better equipment and facilities
- Expand our team with additional researchers
- Begin pilot-scale production trials

Just two months later, on March 30th, 2024, we received another major boost: the HDFC Bank CSR Parivartan startup grant of 10 lakhs. This corporate recognition demonstrated that the private sector also saw value in our sustainable technology solutions.

## Market Validation and Product Launch

With funding secured, 2024 became our year of market validation. We began reaching out to potential customers across various industries:

**Packaging Industry**: Our Greenulos™ nanocellulose showed excellent barrier properties for biodegradable packaging applications.

**Oil and Gas Sector**: Both domestic and marine oil spill kits generated significant interest from environmental cleanup companies.

**Manufacturing**: Various industries began testing our bio-based chemicals as replacements for synthetic alternatives.

The positive market response confirmed that our technology wasn't just scientifically interesting – it solved real problems that customers were willing to pay for.

## Scaling Up: Production and Manufacturing

Establishing our R&D and manufacturing facilities within the IISER Kolkata campus was a strategic decision that paid dividends. Having our research and production in the same location enabled rapid iteration and continuous improvement.

Our small-scale production facility allowed us to:
- Maintain quality control throughout the process
- Quickly implement research improvements
- Provide samples for customer evaluation
- Gather feedback for product optimization

## Recognition on the National Stage: 2025

The beginning of 2025 brought another significant milestone. On January 22nd, 2025, ChemActiva was selected as one of the top 10 startups in 'The BlueEconomy Mission 50 Accelerated Programme' conducted by Bhubaneswar City Knowledge Innovation Cluster (BCKIC) Foundation and KIIT-TBI.

This recognition in the blue economy space was particularly meaningful, as it acknowledged our marine oil spill solutions and their potential impact on ocean conservation. Being selected from hundreds of applicants validated our technology's relevance to one of India's most important environmental challenges.

## Lessons Learned

Looking back on our journey, several key lessons stand out:

### 1. Scientific Excellence is the Foundation
Our success stems from rigorous scientific research and development. Having team members with Ph.D.-level expertise and international experience was crucial in developing world-class technology.

### 2. Market Focus is Essential
While scientific excellence is necessary, it's not sufficient. Understanding customer needs and market dynamics was equally important in shaping our product development.

### 3. Strategic Partnerships Matter
Our relationship with RISE Foundation IISER, our advisory board including distinguished professors, and our collaboration with various institutions provided invaluable support and credibility.

### 4. Persistence Pays Off
