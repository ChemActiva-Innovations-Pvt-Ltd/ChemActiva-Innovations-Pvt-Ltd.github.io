The stock of fossil fuels is limited, but the risk is limitless. So, eliminating petroleum-based products from daily life is not only difficult but also not impossible. Keeping in mind the issue of environmental pollution, people are turning away from petroleum-based products towards bio-based products. They are searching for 'sustainable' solutions, i.e., renewable natural resources for regeneration and finding alternative pathways. It will be long-lasting, environmental friendly as well as providing sustainability to the environment and being beneficial to humanity.

## The Global Shift Toward Bio-Materials

The demand for bio-materials made from renewable resources is now global. Scientists and technologists around the world are engaged in creating highly useful products such as bio-based fuels, fibers, films, foams, and fabrics, whose main components are bio-molecules like cellulose, starch, or proteins. The goal is to create biodegradable and compostable products using adequate and sustainable use of natural resources, which will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

At ChemActiva Innovations, we are at the forefront of this transformation, developing advanced bio-based materials like Greenulos™ and our innovative oil spill kits that demonstrate the practical applications of sustainable chemistry.

## Understanding Bio-Fibers: Nature's Gift to Industry

Bio-fibers obtained from renewable resources mainly are two types: plant and animal fibers.

### Plant Fibers: The Foundation of Sustainable Textiles

Plant fibers refer to natural fibers obtained from plants, such as:
- **Cotton**: The most widely used natural fiber
- **Jute**: Traditional fiber with excellent strength properties
- **Hemp**: Versatile fiber with antimicrobial properties
- **Bamboo**: Fast-growing, naturally antibacterial
- **Flax**: Strong fiber used for linen production
- **Sisal**: Durable fiber from agave plants
- **Kenaf**: Alternative to wood pulp
- **Pineapple leaves**: Innovative use of agricultural waste

The production process involves separating plant biomass into monomers, which are then polymerized to create high molecular weight polymers through a polymerization process. Through appropriate spinning processes, these polymers are transformed into fibers.

### Animal Fibers: Traditional Luxury Materials

Animal fibers include wool from sheep, silk from silkworms, and other natural materials that have been used in the textile and fashion industry for centuries. These materials represent the original sustainable fibers, having been developed through natural evolution.

## Market Demand and Industry Applications

The demand for bio-fibers has increased due to awareness of circular economy practices and reducing carbon footprints. For a health-conscious society, the significant demand for bio-fibers is evident. The popularity of bio-fibers in the textile, packaging, and fashion industries is rising.

### Innovative Applications in Modern Industry

Many renowned brands are incorporating bio-fibers into their products:

**Bamboo Fiber Applications:**
- Special types of socks with moisture-wicking properties
- High-quality bathrobes and towels
- Sanitary napkins with natural anti-bacterial properties
- Bedding materials with temperature regulation

**Hemp/Cannabis Plant Fibers:**
- High-quality clothing fabrics with durability
- Industrial textiles and ropes
- Automotive interior components
- Construction materials

**Jute Fiber Innovations:**
- 'Sonali Bags' as alternatives to non-biodegradable plastic bags
- Packaging materials for various industries
- Decorative and functional home textiles
- Composite materials for construction

### Leading Companies in Bio-Fiber Innovation

Companies like Pact, No Nasties, and Grassroot are bringing fashionable dresses, sanitary napkins, and everyday essentials bags into the market, utilizing bio-fibers. Various startups are working on new ideas using plant-based fibers both nationally and internationally.

At ChemActiva, our work with cellulose nanocrystals (Greenulos™) contributes to this movement by providing enhanced properties to bio-based materials, making them more competitive with synthetic alternatives.

## Global Policy and Regulatory Landscape

The European Union and other developed countries have long shifted their focus towards bio-based fibers, imposing restrictions on petroleum-based synthetic fibers. This regulatory environment creates both challenges and opportunities for companies working in sustainable materials.

### The Challenge in Developing Markets

Despite various bans on the use of petroleum-based products worldwide, countries like India still witness extensive usage of plastic bags in the market. It has been long since plastic bags below 50 microns were prohibited in this country. But the use of it in the markets has been so rampant that now we are at the point of backtracking.

We keep mum, like silent spectators, let alone raise a protest against this malpractice. Our nuclear families in theory do not live up to this ideal in practice, as we use separate bags for separate vegetables. What an irony! 

The question also arises: how can coffee cups with plastic lining be biodegradable? Perhaps in the days ahead we'll cease to exist while in search of light in the womb of darkness or darkness in the womb of light, and then, to be true, though hard a reality, we'll have no scope at all to raise the slogan of being "sustainable."
