# Our Innovations

## 1. Sustainable Chemicals

ChemActiva develops eco-friendly chemicals such as biodegradable polymers, crystalline cellulose with tailor made size, high dispersed crystalline nano cellulose applying green technologies aimed at reducing environmental pollution and supporting cleaner industrial and sustainable practices.

## 2. Oil spill kits

ChemActiva Innovations has tapped into the potential of non-edible, renewable plant materials with hydrophobic and oleophilic properties, capable of absorbing oil up to 50 times their weight. Leveraging these characteristics, ChemActiva has developed a cellulose-based oil spill kit---a green, cost-effective alternative to synthetic sorbents for both domestic and marine applications.

## 3. Bio-Based Solutions

Our work supports the transition toward a bio-based economy by producing materials from renewable biological resources, promoting lower carbon emissions and circular resource use.
