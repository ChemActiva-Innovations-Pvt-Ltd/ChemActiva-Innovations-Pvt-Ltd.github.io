# Nano-Crystalline Cellulose (NCC)

## ChemActiva Innovations: Advancing Sustainability with Nanocellulose Solutions

**Greenulose^TM^**, sodium salt of carboxylated crystalline nano cellulose, derived from plant sources, represents a line of high-performance, biodegradable cellulose nanocrystals. Marketed under the name **Greenulose^TM^**, these carboxylated CNCs are designed to meet a variety of application needs and are available in both powder and liquid forms. Despite being used in small quantities, they deliver significant performance enhancements while maintaining a minimal carbon footprint.

At ChemActiva Innovations, we specialize in the production and commercialization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and formulated nanocellulose solutions. Our mission is to help manufacturers around the world enhance both the environmental sustainability and technical performance of their products through innovative biomaterials.

## Introducing Greenulose^TM^ -- A Sustainable Functional Ingredient

### Why Cellulose Nanocrystals?

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) combine high performance with sustainability. Their nanoscale structure forms effective barriers against liquids, gases, and particles, while surface charges enable selective filtering. Available in versatile formats like additives or films, CNCs are easy to integrate across industries. Derived from plants and fully biodegradable, they offer a green alternative to synthetic materials

### Partner with ChemActiva

Our expert team works closely with clients to integrate CNCs into both existing and new products. Whether you're looking to enhance barrier properties, improve mechanical strength, or meet environmental targets, ChemActiva can help tailor a solution that aligns with your sustainability and performance objectives.

## Sustainability of cellulose nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a sustainable, biodegradable material derived from renewable plant sources. At ChemActiva, we collect waste materials of the plant from artisan for cellulose source. CNCs can replace fossil-based materials, offering an eco-friendly alternative with low environmental impact. Their production creates recyclable by-products and, at ChemActiva Innovations, is powered by green chemical reaction to minimize carbon emissions. CNCs also help reduce the weight---and carbon footprint---of final products, supporting greener material innovation.

## Safety of cellulose nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals are generally considered safe for use in various applications. Cellulose nanocrystals are derived from cellulose, which is a natural and biocompatible material that has been used in various applications for many years. Cellulose nanocrystals are also biodegradable, which means they do not accumulate in the environment or pose a long-term risk to human health or the environment.
