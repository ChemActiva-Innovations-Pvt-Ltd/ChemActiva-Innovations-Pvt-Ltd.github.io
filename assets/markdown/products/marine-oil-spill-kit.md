# Marine Oil Spill Kit (MOSK)

## Oil spills are a major threat to marine ecosystems

Oil spills are a major threat to marine ecosystems, causing long-lasting environmental and economic damage. While synthetic sorbents like polypropylene and polyurethane are commonly used for cleanup, they are costly, non-biodegradable, and contribute to microplastic pollution.

**ChemActiva Innovations** has developed a sustainable alternative material which is naturally hydrophobic and oleophilic, capable of absorbing oil up to 50 times its weight. Through green technology, we've transformed this non-edible, low-cost plant into an **eco-friendly cellulose-based marine oil spill kit**, offering a biodegradable, effective solution for oil spill management.
